# Software-Project-6-Assignment-1
This repository contains my (Tousif Ahmed's) CV (Updated). This is my assignment 1 for SP-6. I can also update my CV further in future with 
the help of Git and Github. A repository contains all of my project's files and each file's revision history. I can discuss and manage my project's work within the repository.

"Repository initialization,

Thank you
